# Introduction

Due to the poor support of the RTL languages by markup languages in general this document will be written in English.

Note that the software is in Arabic which is an RTL language.

خيركم is a software that is intended to help managing students that memorizes Quran and keep track of their progress as well as their attendance.

One file of this software will represent one Hala9a so we can create many Hala9at say one for males and one for females 

Once we have a new Hala9a we can create new teachers and divide the hala9a into small sections (a9sam) if needed
